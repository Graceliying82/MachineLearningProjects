#This code is used to classify some digit handwritings

#This example coming from book Machine Learing in Action Chapter 2. Data is from their original website

#File DataPreparetion_SingleFile and DataPreparation_allData are focusing on how to load data from files and how to reduce the data dimension to fit the knn classification

#File KNN uses the prepared training data to train the classifier and use prepared testing data to test. I may reuse the same data for different classifications in the future.
